# argumentative-engine
An implementation of an argumentation engine of Possibilistic Defeasible Logic Programming based on Dung-semantics.

In this paper, we present a tool for possibilistic logic programming.

A demo of the tool can be watched online at https://youtu.be/joajw2hfkZg (with Spanish audio).

An executable JAR file along with the examples shown here are included. 

This tool is a desktop-based, stand-alone application that assists a user in creating, editing
and querying a possibly inconsistent possibilistic program.

The tool computes all the arguments emerging from the program,
the grounded extension based on Dung-style semantics,
and it is capable of showing arguments and grounded extensions graphically.

The language for programs is enriched with pragmas for allowing the user to configure labels for 
necessity degrees, deciding if using transposes of strict rules, performing consistency checks
within arguments, and appeal to the use of accrual of rules for building arguments.
